Deep in the woods somewhere in the northern tip of Wisconsin lived a wild Yorkie Poo by the name of Vivian. Vivian was held in the highest esteem by local lore. There wasn't a bar in a 100 mile radius that didn't have a picture of this pup plastered somewhere above the bar keep. It wasn't always this way though and not a sigle soul can either confirm nor deny the accounts that follow. Lets being on a brisk winter night. A night so cold you could one felt as if they were only living creature. As if they had been planted on a different planet. This, believe it or not, was where Vivian thrived.
Her claws so terrible, fangs so vicious in these tales, yet only to be have become household myths for misbehaving children. As the people grew more complacent, and the sacrifices neglected. She will not tolerate it. Not in her domain. Tonight, she is ravenous.
