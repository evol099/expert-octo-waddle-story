Deep in the woods somewhere in the northern tip of Wisconsin lived a wild Yorkie Poo by the name of Vivian. Vivian was held in the highest esteem by local lore. There wasn't a bar in a 100 mile radius that didn't have a picture of this pup plastered somewhere above the bar keep. It wasn't always this way though and not a sigle soul can either confirm nor deny the acconts that follow. Lets being on a brisk winter night. A night so cold you could one felt as if they were only living creature. As if they had been planted on a different planet. This, believe it or not, was where Vivian thrived.
